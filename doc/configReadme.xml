As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize accounts from Database to Salesforce organization.

This Template should serve as a foundation for the process of broadcasting accounts from Database to Salesfoce instance. Everytime there is a new account or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in Database source instance and it will be responsible for updating the account in the Salesforce.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages. The integration is triggered by a poll defined in the flow that is going to trigger the application, querying newest Database updates/creations matching a filter criteria and executing the batch job. During the Process stage, each Database Account will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching user in the Salesforce. The last step of the Process stage will group the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce. Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will logoutput statistics data into the console.

<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source (Salesforce) and destination (Database) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. 
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

This particular Anypoint Template illustrate the broadcast use case between Database and a Salesforce, thus it requires a Database instance to work.
The Anypoint Template comes packaged with a SQL script to create the Database table that uses. It is the user responsability to use that script to create the table in an available schema and change the configuration accordingly. The SQL script file can be found in [src/main/resources/account.sql] (../master/src/main/resources/account.sql)

If it is required to connect to a different Database there should be provided the jar for the library and changed the value of that field in the connector.

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. Account Broadcast Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / 200***

Being ***X*** the number of Accounts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Accounts are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the purpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* just executes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). which handles all the logic of it.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.

This is file is conformed by a Flow containing the Poll that will periodically query Database for updated/created Accounts that meet the defined criteria in the query. And then executing the batch job process with the query results.

		<![CDATA[
Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by a batch job that will be responsible for creations/updates. The severeal message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:

1. Job execution is invoked from triggerFlow (endpoints.xml) everytime there is a new query executed asking for created/updated Accounts.
2. During the Process stage, each Database Account will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching Account in the Salesforce.
3. The last step of the Process stage will group the Accounts and create/update them in Salesforce. Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.
